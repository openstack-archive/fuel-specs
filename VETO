  For Fuel team structure and contribution policy, see [1].

  This is Fuel spec VETO file. This file is used to check if a design
  spec has been approved by at least one veto volunteer for all listed
  sections. Otherwise a spec can not be merged. We need this kind
  of check to avoid cross-component design discrepancies.

  Email field in the volunteer dict is mandatory.
