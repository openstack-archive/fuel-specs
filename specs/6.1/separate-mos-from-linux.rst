=============================
Separate MOS from Linux repos
=============================

https://blueprints.launchpad.net/fuel/+spec/separate-mos-from-linux

Problem description
===================

* As a Cloud Operator I should be able to run base distro updates as well as
  Mirantis OpenStack updates during Product Life cycle

* As a Cloud Operator I would like to see what packages are provided by
  Mirantis OpenStack and what packages provided by base distro

* As a Cloud Operator I would like to have support contract for base distro as
  well as Mirantis OpenStack support

* As a Cloud Operator I would like to get security updates as fast as possible
  independantly for base distro as well as for Mirantis OpenStack

* As a Cloud Operator I should be able to see sources of base distro and
  Mirantis OpenStack packages

* As a Cloud Operator I should be able to see debug symbols of base distro and
  Mirantis OpenStack packages

* As a Fuel Developer, I would like to have the same approach for making
  changes to Fuel components and their dependencies.

To provide highest quality Mirantis OpenStack should separate OS lifecycle and
Cloud lifecycle management. Meanwhile OS Updates shouldn't break Mirantis
OpenStack functionality and vice versa.

Proposed change
===============

Types of software packages
--------------------------

This specification introduces a clear separation between base distro (Red Hat
or Debian based Linux OSes), and the Mirantis OpenStack distribution (MOS). All
software packages deployed by Fuel are divided into following categories based
on their relation to the specific base distro and OpenStack distribution being
deployed:

#. *Upstream package*: a package from the supported release of the base distro
   is reused from distro repositories directly, without MOS specific
   modifications.

#. *MOS specific package*: a package which is specific to MOS and does not
   exist in any release of the base distro, or any of the base distro's
   upstream distributions.

#. *Divergent package*: a package that is based on a version of the same
   package from any release of the base distro or its upstream distributions,
   and includes a different software version than the corresponding *upstream
   package*, or additional modifications that are not present in the *upstream
   package*, or both.

   #. *Upgraded package*: a variant of *divergent package* that includes a
      newer software version than the corresponding *upstream package*.

   #. *Holdback package*: a variant of *divergent package* constituting a
      temporary replacement for an *upstream package* to fix a regression
      introduced in the supported release of the base distro. It is published
      in a special MOS repository after a regression is detected, and is
      removed from that repository as soon as the regression is either resolved
      in the upstream package, or addressed elsewhere in Mirantis OpenStack.

.. note:: Downgraded packages with upstream version lower than the version
          available in the base distro are not allowed.

Different releases of MOS can put the same software package in different
categories.

All kinds of divergence from the base distro should be kept to a minimum. As
many of MOS dependencies as possible should be satisfied by upstream packages
from the supported release of the base distro. When possible, MOS patches and
MOS specific packages should be contributed back to base distros.

Distributing MOS packages
-------------------------

Released MOS packages will be distributed as part of Fuel ISO image. Upstream
packages, as well as any other IP protected by respective OS vendors, will not
be the included in Fuel ISO images. Regular updates to the MOS OpenStack
distribution will be delivered through online MOS mirrors.

MOS mirrors structure
---------------------

MOS mirrors should be organized in the same way as base distro mirrors. MOS
mirrors should follow industry standards. The structure of a mirror should be
done in the same way as base distro mirrors.

Every supported OS will have own set of repositories containing MOS packages
per release (mos6.1, mos7.0 etc.) These repositories must contain only packages
with MOS specific modifications, and no upstream packages from the
corresponding base distro.

Mirror should be publicly and globally available and distributed. User should
be able to create and maintain local copies of base distro and MOS mirrors.
This will allow user to use repositories in completely isolated environments or
create own freezed mirrors to pass extended validation before package update
roll-out across production environment.

Debian based mirror structure
-----------------------------

MOS mirror should include several repositories (updates, security, proposed)
built in the same way as base OS mirror (Debian or Ubuntu). Repository sections
are organized in the same way (main, restricted) according to package licenses
(non-free). The meaning of components for Debian mirror resembles the meaning
of components of the base OS distribution mirror.

Repositories priorities
-----------------------

Handling multiple package repositories in Nailgun [1]_ will be expanded to
allow user to set priorities during deployment.

Default repository priorities are arranged so that packages from MOS
repositories are preferred over packages from base distro. On Debian based
systems, the force-downgrade APT pinning priorities are used for MOS
repositories to make sure that, when a package is available in a MOS
repository, it is always preferred over the package from base distro, even if
the version in MOS repository is lower.

Fuel developer repositories
---------------------------

Build system should allow developers to build custom packages. These packages
should be placed into special repository which can be specified in Nailgun [1]_
to deliver these packages to an environment. APT pinning priority for these
repositories should be higher than base distro and MOS repositories.
Accordingly, Yum repository priority value must be lower than base distro and
MOS repositories.

In the future, this functionality should be exposed to the community allowing
any community engineer (e.g. nova, cinder) to specify their own git refspec
(repository and commit). The build system should be able to build packages and
provide a link which can be passed through Nailgun.

Holdback repository
-------------------

Holdback repository is a measure aimed to ensure the highest quality of MOS
product. If there is an *upstream* package that breaks the product, and this
problem cannot be fixed in a timely manner, MOS team publishes the package
proven stable to the "mosXX-holdback" repository. This repository should be
automatically configured on all installations with priority higher than base
distro repositories.

The case when base distro vendor releases fixed version of a problem package,
must be covered by MOS system tests.

Ideally, upstream updates shouldn't break the functionality of Product. The
number of packages in "mosXX-holdback" should be zero. Even if package is put
in repository, MOS team should contact base distro vendor to report the
regression. Package Update should be discarded before it appears in Update
repository. If package is supposed to appear in update repository, MOS team
should update "mosXX-holdback" repository before that.

Testing in "mosXX-holdback" repository should be done against every package as
next release may fix the regression that might occur. Once regression is fixed
in upstream the package should be removed from "mosXX-holdback" repository.

Package versioning requirements
-------------------------------

Package version string for a *MOS specific* or *divergent* package must not
include registered trademarks of base distro vendors, and should include "mos"
keyword.

Every new revision of a *MOS specific* or *divergent* package targeted to a MOS
release (including corresponding update repository) must have a package version
greater than or equal to the versions of the same package in all previous
releases of MOS (base, update, security repositories), as well as versions of
the same package previously published in any repos for this MOS release.

For example, there must be no package version downgrades in the following MOS
release progression (where 6.1.1 matches the state of update repository at the
time of 6.1.1 maintenance release):

    6.0 <= 6.0.1 <= 6.1 <= 6.1.1 <= 6.1.2 <= 7.0

Package version of a *divergent* package (including *upgraded* and *holdback*
packages) must be constructed in a way that would allow the *upstream* package
with the same software version to be automatically considered for upgrade by
package management system as soon as the divergent package is removed from the
MOS repositories. This will simplify phasing out divergent packages in favor of
upstream packages between major MOS releases, but, thanks to repo priorities
defined above, will not lead to new upstream packages superceding *upgraded*
packages available from MOS repos when applying updates.

Every new revision of a *divergent* package must have a package version greater
than previous revisions of the same package that were published to the same
repository for that MOS release. It's version should be lower than version of
the corresponding *upstream* package.

When the same package version is ported from one MOS release to another without
modifications (i.e. same upstream version and same set of patches), new package
version should include full package version from the original MOS release.

Debian package versioning
-------------------------

Versioning requirements defined in this section apply to all software packages
in all MOS repositories for Debian based distros. The standard terms defined in
Debian Policy[7]_ are used to describe package version components: epoch,
upstream version, Debian revision.

Upstream version of a package should exactly match the software version,
without suffixes. Introducing epoch or increasing epoch relative to base distro
should be avoided.

Debian revision of a MOS package should use the following format::

    <revision>~<base-distro-release>+mos<subrevision>

In MOS specific packages, revision must always be "0"::

    fuel-nailgun_6.1-0~u14.04+mos1

In *divergent* packages, revision should include as much of the debian revision
of the corresponding *upstream* package as possible while excluding the base
distro vendor's trademarks::

    qemu_2.1.0-1           -> qemu_2.1.0-1~u14.04+mos1
    ohai_6.14.0-2.3ubuntu4 -> ohai_6.14.0-2.3~u14.04+mos1

Subrevision numbering starts from 1. Subsequent revisions of a package using
the same upstream version and based on the upstream package with the same
debian revision should increment the subrevision::

    ohai_6.14.0-2.3~u14.04+mos2
    ohai_6.14.0-2.3~u14.04+mos3

Subsequent revision of a package that introduces a new upstream version or new
base distro package revision should reset the subrevision back to 1::

    ohai_6.14.0-3ubuntu1 -> ohai_6.14.0-3~u14.04+mos1

Versioning of packages in post-release updates 
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Once a MOS release reaches GA, the primary package repository for the release
is frozen, and subsequent updates are published to the updates repositories.

Most of the time, only a small subset of modifications (including patches,
metadata changes, etc.) will be backported to updates for old MOS releases.
When updated package includes only a subset of modifications, its version
should include the whole package version from the primary repository, followed
by a reference to the targeted MOS release, and an update subrevsion, both
separated by "+"::

    mos6.1:         qemu_2.1.0-1~u14.04+mos1
    mos7.0:         qemu_2.1.0-1~u14.04+mos1
    mos7.1:         qemu_2.1.0-1~u14.04+mos2
    mos6.1-updates: qemu_2.1.0-1~u14.04+mos1+mos6.1+1
    mos7.0-updates: qemu_2.1.0-1~u14.04+mos1+mos7.0+1

If the whole package along with all included modifications is backported from
current release to updates for an old MOS release, its version should include
the whole package version from the current release, followed by a reference to
the targeted MOS release separated by "~", and an update subrevision, separated
by "+"::

    mos6.1:         qemu_2.1.0-1~u14.04+mos1
    mos7.0:         qemu_2.1.0-1~u14.04+mos1
    mos7.1:         qemu_2.1.0-1~u14.04+mos2
    mos6.1-updates: qemu_2.1.0-1~u14.04+mos2~mos6.1+1
    mos7.0-updates: qemu_2.1.0-1~u14.04+mos2~mos7.0+1

Same rule applies if modifications include an upgrade to a newer software
version::

    mos6.1:         qemu_2.1.0-1~u14.04+mos1
    mos7.0:         qemu_2.1.0-1~u14.04+mos1
    mos7.1:         qemu_2.2+dfsg-5exp~u14.04+mos3
    mos6.1-updates: qemu_2.2+dfsg-5exp~u14.04+mos3~mos6.1+1
    mos7.0-updates: qemu_2.2+dfsg-5exp~u14.04+mos3~mos7.0+1

Debian package metadata
-----------------------

All *MOS specific* and *divergent* packages must have the following metadata:

#. Latest entry in the debian/changelog must contain:

   - reference to the targeted MOS release series (e.g. mos6.1)

   - reference to the organization that produced the package (Mirantis)

   - commits (full git commit sha1) in all source code repositories that the
     package was built from: build repository commit if both source code and
     build scripts are tracked in the same repository (git-buildpackage style),
     or both source and build repository commits if source code is tracked in a
     separate repository from build scripts

#. Maintainer in debian/control must be MOS Team

Example of a valid debian/changelog entry::

  keystone (2014.2.3-1~u14.04+mos1) mos6.1; urgency=low

    * Source commit: 17f8fb6d8d3b9d48f5a4206079c18e84b73bf36b
    * Build commit: 8bf699819c9d30e2d34e14e76917f94daea4c67f

   -- Mirantis OpenStack Team <mos@mirantis.com>  Sat, 21 Mar 2015 15:08:01 -0700

If the package is a backport from a different release of a base distro (e.g. a
backport of a newer software version from Ubuntu 14.10 to Ubuntu 14.04), the
exact package version which the backport was based on must also be specified in
the debian/changelog entry, along with the URL where the source package for
that package version can be obtained from.

Following types of URLs may be used, in the order of preference:

#. git-buildpackage or similar source code repository,

#. deb package pool directory,

#. direct dpkg source (orig and debian) download links.

Package lifecycle management
----------------------------

To deliver high quality of product MOS teams should produce package updates
during Product lifecycle when it's required.

Packaging lifecycle should follow the MOS product lifecycle (Feature Freeze,
Soft Code Freeze, Hard Code Freeze, Release, Updates).

MOS mirror should be modified on Hard Code Freeze announcement. A new MOS
version should be created in order to allow developers to continue on new
release.

After GA release all packages should be placed in updates or security

Patches for security vulnerabilities should be placed in *security* repository.
They are designed to change to change the behavior of the package as little as
possible. In fact, the minimum required to resolve the security problem. As a
result, they tend to be very low-risk to apply and all users are urged to apply
security updates.

Package flow should be specified from building package, incubating package in
*proposed* repository (mos6.1-proposed as a sample), acceptance testing,
security testing before it will appear in *updates* in MOS mirror.

Continous integration testing against base distro updates
---------------------------------------------------------

As a part of a product lifecycle there should be periodical system tests that
verify functionality of MOS against:

- the current state of base distro mirror (base system plus released updates),
  to check stability of current release
- the current state of the Stable Release Updates [2]_ or Fasttrack repository
  [3]_, to check if package candidates introduce any regressions

In order to facilitate QA testing, we should create a full dependencies graph
for MOS packages, add missing requirements from appropriate requirements.txt
files, and use this list for system tests.

Handling of system test results
-------------------------------

If the system test against proposed[2]_ or Fasttrack repositories[3]_ reveals
one or several packages that break MOS functionality, MOS teams must provide
one of the following solutions:

- solve the issue on the product side by releasing fixed MOS packages through
  the "updates" repository
- raise a debate with base distro SRU reviewing team regarding problem packages
- (if none of the above helps) put working version of a problem package to
  the holdback repository

Also, any package that failed the system test, must be reflected on the
release status page.

Release status page
-------------------

To ensure that MOS customers have full info on the release stability, all
packages that produce system test failures must be also reported in several
different ways:

- via web: via status page on the https://fuel-infra.org/ website
- on deployed nodes: via hook that updates MOTD using the above website
- on deployed nodes: via apt pre-hook that checks the status via the above
  website, and warns customer in case if "apt-get update" command is issued

Packages building module
------------------------

Fuel DEB packages build routine will be dropped. Fuel DEB packages will be
consumed from the MOS mirror directly on master node. [1]_

Control files for Fuel DEB packages will be moved to the public MOS Gerrit
instance.

Explicit list of Fuel DEB packages is below:

* fencing-agent
* nailgun-mcagents
* nailgun-net-check
* nailgun-agent
* python-tasklib

Docker containers building module
---------------------------------

All Dockerfile configs will be adjusted to include both upstream and MOS
repositories.

ISO assembly module
-------------------

ISO assembly module will be adjusted to exclude all parts mentioned above.

Offline installations
---------------------

There's various reasoning behind having a local mirrors of base distro,
from security considerations, to making deployments faster and more reliable.
To support such installation cases we will implement the Linux console
script that mirrors the public base distro and MOS mirrors to a given location,
allowing to put these local sources as input for the appropriate menu entry of
Fuel "Settings" tab on UI, or specify directly via Fuel CLI. In case of
deb-based base distro, MOS requires packages from multiple sections of a given
distribution (main, universe, multiverse, restricted), so the helper script
will mirror all packages from components specified above. Requirements:

* input base distro mirror URL
* input MOS mirror URL
* ability to run as cronjob to update base distro and MOS mirrors

Alternatives
------------

There is no alternative to the repositories separation approach due to
considerations related to distribution policies of major OS vendors.
Regarding the helper script to download base distro repositories, there
could be a different approach implemented, by downloading only particular
packages that required by MOS. However, we consider that providing a full
upstream repository would make customer experience a bit better, especially
in cases when additional upstream packages that are not a part of MOS need
to be installed).

Data model impact
-----------------

None

REST API impact
---------------

None

Upgrade impact
--------------

When Fuel master node is upgraded to a version that supports Linux distro
separation, package repositories for old versions of MOS deployed by previous
version of Fuel will keep using the old mirror structure. Package repositories
for the new versions of MOS will use the structure defined in this
specification.

Also see support-ubuntu-trusty [5]_ on the upgrade impact of switching the base
Ubuntu version from 12.04 (precise) to 14.04 (trusty).

Security impact
---------------

None

Notifications impact
--------------------

None

Other end user impact
---------------------

In case of offline installations, user will be required to create a copy of MOS
and base distro mirrors by using a script described in this document.

Performance Impact
------------------

If packages are consumed from remote 3rd party servers, overall deployment
time may be increased. In case of offline installation, no deployment speed
degradation is expected.

Other deployer impact
---------------------

Changes described in this document allow to increase product flexibility,
by making possible to choose an operating system and install it independent
of MOS.

Developer impact
----------------

None

Work Items
----------

* Create local OS mirrors for CI purposes
* Change Fuel make system to exclude DEB packages from ISO
* Create MOS mirror with the same structure as OS vendor
* Deb package build process should be changed. All packages should be put in
  MOS mirror
* Create CI Jobs to test against OS vendor SRU [2]_
* Create status page to notify customers in case of problems with OS updates.
   - Create apt hooks to notify the customer in case of "apt-get upgrade"
* Adapt system tests of Ubuntu for the new repositories workflow
* Implement script for creating of local base distro and MOS mirrors on master
  node.

Dependencies
============

None

Testing
=======

As this document introduces structural changes to the ISO composition and
MOS mirrors layout, testing procedure must reflect the updated workflow
for deploying Ubuntu environments described in this blueprint. [1]_

* Test if master node can be bootstrapped
* Test if CentOS cluster can be deployed
* Test if Ubuntu cluster can be deployed

Documentation Impact
====================

The documentation should cover:

* The description of the new MOS package lifecycle, including mirrors structure
  and package versioning and metadata conventions.

* How to use the script for creating local base OS and MOS mirrors for
  deployment in an environment without direct Internet access.
