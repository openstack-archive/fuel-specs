==============================
Segment Settings tab logically
==============================

https://blueprints.launchpad.net/fuel/+spec/segment-settings-tab-logically

The current Settings groupings are not intuitive for users, and it is not
possible for additional settings to be included into the previously defined
groups. This causes a proliferation of settings headers and poor user
experience when attempting to locate a relevant setting.


--------------------
Problem description
--------------------

There is a real mess on the Settings tab - groups are malformed: some of them
contain only one checkbox, others contain not related information. It's not
clear for the user where to find the needed settings item.


----------------
Proposed changes
----------------

It is suggested to move component-related settings under one subtab, so that,
e.g. Aсcess-related settings will be under one tab and Storage-related under
other.

There are also some network settings on the Settings tab, which is not
correct, because we have a separate Networks tab for networks management.


Web UI
======

#. The existing Settings tab will be restructured - they will split 
   to several groups:
  * General
  * Security
  * Compute
  * Storage
  * Logging
  * OpenStack Services

   Settings with undefined group will go to the 'Other'group.
   Additionally, plugins can provide their own groups.

   Settings with 'network' group - will not shown on Settings tab anymore.

To define group for settings - there will be new 'group' attribute into
metadata section of openstack.yaml file:

.. code-block:: yaml

  additional_components:
    metadata:
        label: "Additional Components"
        weight: 20
        group: "openstack_services"

Common settings will be split to several groups - Compute, Storage
and Logging.

To define groups for particular Common settings there will be new
'group' attribute inside every singular settings separetely:

.. code-block:: yaml

    common:
      metadata:
        label: "Common"
        weight: 30
      debug:
        value: false
        label: "OpenStack debug logging"
        group: "logging"
        ...
      nova_quota:
        value: false
        label: "Nova quotas"
        group: "compute"
        ...

The list of current environment settings organized by groups:

* General:

  * Kernel parameters ["kernel_params"]
  * Host OS DNS Servers ["external_dns"]
  * Host OS NTP Servers ["external_ntp"]
  * Repositories ["repo_setup"]
  * Workloads Collector User ["workloads_collector"]
  * Corosync ["corosync"]
  * Provision ["provision"]

* Security:

  * Access ["access"]
  * Common ["common"] > Public Key ["auth_key"]
  * Public TLS ["public_ssl"]

* Compute:

  * Common ["common"] > Nova quotas ["nova_quota"]
  * Common ["common"] > Hypervisor type ["libvirt_type"]
  * Common ["common"] > Resume guests state on host boot
    ["resume_guests_state_on_host_boot"]
  * Common ["common"] > ["use_vcenter"]

* Storage:

  * Common ["common"] > Use qcow format for images ["use_cow_images"]
  * Storage ["storage"]

* Logging:

  * Common ["common"] > OpenStack debug logging ["debug"]
  * Common ["common"] > Puppet debug logging ["puppet_debug"]
  * Syslog ["syslog"]

* OpenStack Services:

  * Additional Components ["additional_components"]
  * External MongoDB ["external_mongo"]
  * Murano Settings ["murano_settings"]

The proposed change for Settings tab:
 .. image:: ../../images/8.0/segment-settings-tab-logically/settings-group.png

Groups will be sorted alphabetically. Settings in the group will be sorted by
their weight.

#. All settings under current 'Network' group will move to the Network Tab

* Network:

  * Neutron Advanced Configuration ["neutron_advanced_configuration"]
  * Public network assignment ["public_network_assignment"]
  * Common ["common"] > Auto assign floating IP
    ["auto_assign_floating_ip"]
  * Mellanox Neutron components ["neutron_mellanox"]

The proposed cnange for Network tab:
 .. image:: ../../images/8.0/segment-settings-tab-logically/network-tab.png

Nailgun
=======

In openstack.yaml in 'metadata' section of setting - will be added a new
'group' attribute, so that it will be possible to specify the corresponding
settings group for the setting.

List of possible 'group' values:
  * 'general'
  * 'security'
  * 'compute'
  * 'network'
  * 'storage'
  * 'logging'
  * 'openstack_services'

For Common settings, which should be splitted to several groups, there is
no changes inside metadata section, but 'group' attribute added inside every
singular settings separetely.

Plugins
=======

Plugin should be able to define its group (it can be group from the list
above, or plugin can provide own group). In case a plugin does not have
a group specified, the plugin will be placed under 'Others' group in Fuel UI

New 'group' attribute will be added for OpenStack Environment settings which
will give the developers an ability to structure their settings logically.

Documentation impact
--------------------

Specific mentions of settings should be change according to the new structure.
Also plugins and developers documentation should be updated to mention this new
field.

Work Items
==========

#. Make a decision on appropriate settings grouping
#. Restructure settings tab according to the new segmentation
#. Move network-related settings to the Networks tab

Dependencies
============

None.

------------
Testing, QA
------------

#. Manual testing
#. UI functional tests of Settings and Networks tabs should be updated
   accordingly.


Acceptance criteria
===================

#. Settings tab content is easy to read and navigate even for newbie users
#. All network-related settings are on Networks tab
