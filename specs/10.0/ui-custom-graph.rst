Manage Custom Graphs from Fuel UI
=================================

https://blueprints.launchpad.net/fuel/+spec/ui-custom-graph

This blueprint extends Fuel UI with ability to list, remove, upload, download,
and run custom workflows (custom graphs) that are sets of arbitrary deployment
actions such maintenance of cluster, security updates and even upgrades [1].


--------------------
Problem description
--------------------

Now Fuel UI gives User no instruments to view, remove, upload, download, or
execute custom deployment graphs. At the same time, an ability to do this
would help to operate with complex life-cycle management (LCM) use cases
such bug fixing and other cluster updates.


----------------
Proposed changes
----------------


Web UI
======

Workflows tab
-------------

Cluster page in Fuel UI should be extended with new 'Workflows' tab.

The 'Workflows' tab should contain a table with all graphs available for
the cluster.
Rows in a workflows table should be grouped by graph level that can be
'release', 'plugin' or 'cluster'.

Workflows table should have the following columns:

* graph name
* graph type
* 'Download' button (to download the graph tasks in JSON format)
* 'Delete' button (to remove the graph; available for graphs of 'cluster'
  level only)

+-------------------+-------------+-----------+-----------+
| Graph Name        | Graph Type  |           |           |
+===================+=============+===========+===========+
| RELEASE           |             |           |           |
+-------------------+-------------+-----------+-----------+
| release_graph     | default     | Download  |           |
+-------------------+-------------+-----------+-----------+
| mu-1-release      | 9.0-mu-1    | Download  |           |
+-------------------+-------------+-----------+-----------+
+-------------------+-------------+-----------+-----------+
| PLUGIN "LMA"      |             |           |           |
+-------------------+-------------+-----------+-----------+
| lma-plugin        | default     | Download  |           |
+-------------------+-------------+-----------+-----------+
| lma-plugin        | upgrade     | Download  |           |
+-------------------+-------------+-----------+-----------+
+-------------------+-------------+-----------+-----------+
| PLUGIN "CONTRAIL" |             |           |           |
+-------------------+-------------+-----------+-----------+
| release_graph     | default     | Download  |           |
+-------------------+-------------+-----------+-----------+
+-------------------+-------------+-----------+-----------+
| CLUSTER           |             |           |           |
+-------------------+-------------+-----------+-----------+
| cluster_graph     | default     | Download  |  Delete   |
+-------------------+-------------+-----------+-----------+
| mu-1-cluster      | 9.0-mu-1    | Download  |  Delete   |
+-------------------+-------------+-----------+-----------+

Note that workflows table should not include graphs of not enabled cluster
plugins.

Graph should be sorted by type in the table and graphs with 'default' type
should go first.

Workflows table should support filtering by deployment graph level and by
graph type. Both filters should support multiple values selection.

To delete a graph User have to confirm the action in confirmation pop-up by
entering the graph type.


The 'Workflows' tab should also display a form for uploading a new graph for
the current cluster (the new graph level will be 'cluster').
To do this User should fill the following fields:

* graph verbose name
  (optional; graph can have an empty verbose name)
* graph type
  (mandatory; should be unique within graphs of 'cluster' level and related
  to current cluster; the input should be validated across `^[a-zA-Z0-9-_]+$`
  regexp)
* file with graph tasks data in JSON format
  (optional; graph can be empty `{}`)


There should be also a list of merged graphs on the tab (graphs of all levels
that have the same type are merged into a single resulting graph).
Fuel UI user should be able to download file with merged graph tasks
in JSON format.

+-------------------+-----------+
| Graph Type        |           |
+===================+===========+
| default           | Download  |
+-------------------+-----------+
| 9.0-mu-1          | Download  |
+-------------------+-----------+
| upgrade           | Download  |
+-------------------+-----------+


Dashboard tab
-------------

Fuel UI user should be able to start execution of custom graph of a particular
type or the sequence of graphs.

Top block on the 'Dashboard' tab that represents deployment modes should be
extended by a new 'Custom Workflows' mode.

Working in this deployment mode, User should specify a sequence of graph types
he wants to execute (that defines the execution order of the graphs).
All cluster graphs except 'default' type are available in this deployment
mode. And 'default' graph already executed by clicking existing
'Deploy Changes' button in Fuel UI.

User should also click 'Select Nodes' button to open a standard 'Select Nodes'
pop-up to specify nodes for selected graphs execution.
All cluster nodes are selected in the pop-up by default.

Graph execution can not be launched from Fuel UI if no cluster nodes selected.
Graphs also can not be executed if any of the selected nodes is offline.

When execution of selected graphs started, Fuel UI gets an appropriate
deployment tasks collection. Fuel UI should display a progress bar on
Dashboard to represent Ñ„ total progress of the graphs execution. By clicking
on the progress bar, deployment history [2] of current running deployment task
should be shown.

Data model
----------

No changes required.


REST API
--------

No changes required.

Existing API should be used by Fuel UI:

* `GET /clusters/<cluster_id>/deployment_graphs/` to get all graphs available
  for a particular cluster (graphs of different levels)

  Response data is returned in the following format:

  .. code-block:: json

    [
      {
        id: 1,
        name: null,
        relations: {
          type: 'default',
          model: 'cluster',
          model_id: 1
        },
        tasks: [...]
      },
      {
        id: 2,
        name: 'some name',
        relations: {
          type: 'default',
          model: 'release',
          model_id: 1
        },
        tasks: [...]
      },
      {
        id: 3,
        name: 'my plugin graph',
        relations: {
          type: 'plugin123',
          model: 'plugin',
          model_id: 12
        },
        tasks: [...]
      },
      ...
    ]

* `GET /releases/<release_id>/deployment_tasks/?graph_type=<graph_type>`
  with 'Accept: application/json' header to download tasks for a particular
  graph of 'release' level

* `GET /clusters/<cluster_id>/deployment_tasks/?graph_type=<graph_type>`
  with 'Accept: application/json' header to download tasks for a particular
  graph of 'cluster' level

* `GET /plugins/<plugin_id>/deployment_tasks/?graph_type=<graph_type>`
  with 'Accept: application/json' header to download tasks for a particular
  graph of 'plugin' level

* `DELETE /clusters/<cluster_id>/deployment_graphs/<graph_type>` to remove
  a graph of 'cluster' level

* `GET /clusters/<cluster_id>/deployment_tasks/?graph_type=<graph_type>`
  with 'Accept: application/json' header to download merged tasks for
  a particular graph

* `POST /clusters/<cluster_id>/deployment_graphs/` to create a new graph for
  the current cluster (the graph level will be 'cluster').

  Data in the following format should be sent by Fuel UI:

  .. code-block:: json

    {
      name: 'my graph name',
      relations: {
        type: 'my_graph_type',
        model: 'cluster',
        model_id: 1
      },
      tasks: {
        name: 'my file name',
        content: '...'
      }
    }

* `PUT /cluster/<cluster_id>/deploy/?graph_type=<graph_type_3>,<graph_type_1>`
  with empty data to run graphs on all cluster nodes

* `PUT /cluster/<cluster_id>/deploy/?graph_type=<graph_type>&nodes=<node_ids>`
  with empty data to run graphs on a subset of nodes
