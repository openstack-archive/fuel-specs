==========================================
Ability To Execute Custom Deployment Graph
==========================================


https://blueprints.launchpad.net/fuel/+spec/custom-graph-execution

This blueprint introduces a new feature allowing
a user to execute particular deployment graph
with ability to merge it with existing
deployment graphs of upstream master release.
This would allow a user to implement complex orchestrated
workflows such bugfixes application, reference architecture
altering or even upgrades.


-------------------
Problem description
-------------------

As a deployment engineer I would prefer to have an opportunity
to apply one-shot fixes or workflows which require complex orchestration
such as 'detach DB on the fly and move it to another cluster of nodes' or
even upgrades, while the most common case is application of bugfixes
which require more than simple packages installation.

----------------
Proposed changes
----------------

The proposed change assumes that each deployed cluster has 3 classes of
deployment graphs with the following hierarchy (in descending order of
importance):

* Cluster-specific Graph (most important)

* Graphs introduced by plugins (graphs of enabled plugins merged by task id)

* Release-default Graph (least important)

The feature essentially extends model of graphs being used to allow
typisation of graphs being used during deployment. Custom graph may be of
any particular type and will be stored in the database with this type.
Default deployment graphs will have type 'default'. Thus, this feature
assumes FULL BACKWARD compatibility with existing methods of calculation
of pre-serialized deployment graph representation.


Graph serialization is performed by the following technique. Each deployment
run executes deployment of particular **type** ('default' by default).

Nailgun module introduced by this feature which is responsible for graph
merge fetches graphs of each class for corresponding type of deployment
and merges them by merging all task IDs where low-level attributes override
the higher ones.

Example (in order of graphs overriding):

.. |darr| unicode:: 0x2193

Default deployment

Release **default** graph - derived from tasks.yaml of fuel-library

  |darr|

Plugins **default** graphs (deployment tasks from plugins)

  |darr|

Cluster **default** graph (empty by default)
with cluster-specific tasks specified by the user


UseCase1

Release **usecase1** graph - empty for now but can be derived
from tasks.yaml of fuel-library or be delivered by MUs

  |darr|

Plugins **usecase1** graphs
can be specified by plugin developers

  |darr|

Cluster **usecase1** graph (empty by default)
with cluster-specific tasks specified by the user

All the changes are going to be related to Nailgun and python-fuelclient
parts.

Web UI
======

None so far

Nailgun
=======

Main changes are going to happen within the pieces that construct preserialized
graphs which essentially resemble a list of dictionaries of deployment tasks.

There will be 3 sources of data:

* Default release graph derived from /etc/puppet/modules

* Cluster-specific graph uploaded by user

* Plugins graph which is a function of plugin and cluster metadata merger

Data model
----------

5 new models are going to be added:

* DeploymentGraph
  A model that contains a list of IDs of deployment graphs

  * id           = Graph ID

  * name = User readable name of graph

* ReleaseDeploymentGraph
  This one is going to store couplings between releases and particular
  deployment graphs

  * id

  * type - Graph type

  * deployment_graph_id - Graph ID from DeploymentGraph table

  * release_id - Release ID

* PluginDeploymentGraph
  This one is going to store couplings between releases and particular
  plugin deployment graphs

  * id

  * type - Graph type

  * deployment_graph_id - Graph ID from DeploymentGraph table

  * plugin_id - Plugin ID

* ClusterDeploymentGraph
  This one is going to store info on particular cluster deployment graphs

  * id

  * type - Graph type

  * deployment_graph_id - Graph ID from DeploymentGraph table

  * cluster_id - Cluster ID

* DeploymentGraphTask
  This model actually represents a list of tasks with their metadata
  and which graph they are connected to

    * id - Task id. not identical to id of task in the yaml file

    * deployment_graph_id - Id of the graph the task belongs to

    * task_name - Task name. Identical to 'id' field of the task in the
      yaml file. Unique within every graph.

    * version, type, groups, tasks, roles, reexecute_on, refresh_on,
      required_for, requires, cross_depended_by, cross_depends,
      parameters - corresponding fields of the deployment tasks

    * _custom - custom task fields provided by the user that do not fall
      into the list above

Deployment graph data lifecycle
-------------------------------

It is possible to `create`, `update`, `delete` deployment graph and establish
relations from deployment graph to the Release, Cluster and Plugin records.

Creation
^^^^^^^^

Graph `type` and related model `id` + `type` is required to create graph.
Graph `tasks` and graph `name` is optional.

There could be only one graph of given `type` related to the external model. So
any graph could be addressed by external model ID and graph `type`.

Clusters is supposed to be default relation target for the custom graphs.

Default graph type is `default` and this type will be used in all operations
if no type is specified.

Update
^^^^^^

Graph `name` (verbose name, not `type`) and graph tasks could be updated.
During update Nailgun completely removes all graph tasks and creating new.

For every combination graph_type + external model graph ID in database stays
persistent until graph is deleted directly.

Deletion
^^^^^^^^

Tasks is related as many-to-one to the deployment graph and will be cascade
deleted when graph is removed.

Graph external relation is cascade deleted when external model is removed or
graph is removed.

Every graph is related only to one external model when parent model is
removed, this graph is removed automatically. It is not possible to create
graph shared between different models due artificial limitation that could be
removed in future.

REST API
--------

An API handler should be introduced to support:

* list existing graphs for specified cluster

* upload graph from yaml file by graph type and class
  for specified cluster (only for cluster graph)

* download existing graph or merge of some existing graphs
  to yaml file by graph type and class for specified cluster

* delete existing graph by graph type and class
  from specified cluster (only for cluster graph)

* execute existing graph with graph type
  on the subset of nodes or whole cluster

Graph GET JSON format
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Relations is added to serialized graph info that allow to track models to
which this graph is related.

.. code-block:: json

  {
    "name": "Verbose Graph Name",
    "tasks": [
      {
        "id": "my-task",
        "type": "puppet",
        "parameters": {
          ...
        }
      },
      ...
    ],
    "relations": [
      {
        "type": "default",
        "model": "Release",
        "model_id": 1
      },
      ...
    ]
  }

Graph POST/PUT/PATCH JSON format
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. code-block:: json

  {
    "name": "Verbose Graph Name",
    "tasks": [
      {
        "id": "my-task",
        "type": "puppet",
        "parameters": {
          ...
        }
      },
      ...
    ]
  }

Operations with graph by graph ID
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Metainformation about graphs (list of graphs with names and their relations)
  `GET /graphs/`

* Get Information about specific graph
  `{'name': 'name', 'relations': '[...]', 'tasks': '[...]'}`

  `GET /graphs/<graph-id>`

* Update graph
  `PUT /graphs/<graph-id>`

* Delete graph
  `DELETE /graphs/<graph-id>`

Operations with graph via different models
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Get all graphs for release
  ``GET /releases/<release_id>/deployment_graphs/``

* Operate specific type for Release
  ``GET/POST/PUT/PATCH/DELETE /releases/<release_id>/deployment_graphs/<graph_type>/``

* Get deployment tasks for the Release
  Existing ``GET /releases/<release_id>/deployment_tasks/``
  Should be extended with `graph_type` parameter for the consistency with
  cluster ``/deployment_tasks`` handler (see below)

* Get all graphs for Cluster
  ``GET /clusters/<cluster_id>/deployment_graphs/``

* Get merged tasks for the environment
  Existing ``GET /clusters/<cluster_id>/deployment_tasks/``
  Should be extended with ``graph_type`` parameter

* Operate specific type related to Cluster
  ``GET/POST/PUT/PATCH/DELETE /clusters/<cluster_id>/deployment_graphs/<graph_type>/``

* Get all graphs for Plugin
  ``GET /plugins/<cluster_id>/deployment_graphs/``

* Operate specific type related to plugin
  ``GET/POST/PUT/PATCH/DELETE /plugins/<plugin_id>/deployment_graphs/<graph_type>/``


Run custom graph
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Graph should be ran for given cluster with optional nodes list.
And it is not possible to run graph without cluster.

* Existing `PUT /cluster/<cluster_id>/deploy/`
  Should be extended with `graph_type` parameter.

Other API changes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Existing `GET /clusters/<cluster_id>/serialized_tasks/`
  Should be extended with `graph_type` parameter.

* Existing `GET /clusters/<cluster_id>/deploy_tasks/graph.gv`
  Should be extended with `graph_type` parameter.


Orchestration
=============

None

RPC Protocol
------------

None

Fuel Client
===========

Fuel client should be modified to support usage of one-shot or continuous
custom graphs, e.g. CRUD operations with the graph and triggering of
deployment of the particular graph *type* within the cluster

Fuel CLI interface `graph` command should be extended:

Graphs listing
--------------

Returns table with graphs, graphs relations/types and names

* fuel2 graph list --env env_id

Graph uploading
---------------

* fuel2 graph upload --env env_id [--type graph_type] --file tasks.yaml

* fuel2 graph upload --release release_id [--type graph_type] --file tasks.yaml

* fuel2 graph upload --plugin plugin_id [--type graph_type] --file tasks.yaml

`--type` is optional. ‘default’ graph type with confirmation should be used if
no type is defined.


Graph downloading
-----------------

* fuel2 graph download --env env_id --all [--type graph_type]
  [--file cluster_graph.yaml]

* fuel2 graph download --env env_id --cluster [--type graph_type]
  [--file cluster_graph.yaml]

* fuel2 graph download --env env_id --plugins [--type graph_type]
  [--file plugins_graph.yaml]

* fuel2 graph download --env env_id --release [--type graph_type]
  [--file release_graph.yaml]

`--type` is optional and ‘default’ graph will be downloaded in no type is
defined.

Graph execution
---------------

* fuel2 graph execute --env env_id [--type graph_type] [--node node_ids]

Graph execution available only for the environment.

Plugins
=======

None

Fuel Library
============
