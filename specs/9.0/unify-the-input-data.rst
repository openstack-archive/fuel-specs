Unify the input data
=========================================

https://blueprints.launchpad.net/packetary/+spec/unify-input-data

We need to unify the Packetary input data format for the command that copies a
repository.

--------------------
Problem description
--------------------

Both Nailgun and Fuel-mirror use the same single format to describe parameters
of the repository. Unlike these, Packetary uses a plain text string, which is
inconvenient. We need to unify the data format for all commands and operations.

----------------
Proposed changes
----------------

We propose to use in Packetary the same data format used in Nailgun and
Fuel-mirror. The proposed data format is the following:

1. Repositories input data format:

  * name field - A single word identifying the repository name

  * uri field - Uniform Resource Identifier for repository root. Describe in
    rfc3986

  * type field - single word. It can be "rpm" or "deb", depending to the
    packages format which used in the repository

  * suite field - Describe repositories types ($release, $release-security,
    $release-updates, $release-backports). This is applicable only for DEB
    repositories.

  * section field - a list of areas separated by a whitespace. This is
    applicable only for DEB repositories.

  * path field - This field can be absolute or relative path pointing to
    directory where repository is copied.

  * priority field - Integer field that allows changing the behaviour of
    selecting a package. In general, the format depends on the repository
    driver. For example: DEB repository expects general values from 0 to 1000. 0
    to have lowest priority and 1000 -- the highest. Note that a priority above
    1000 will allow even downgrades no matter the version of the prioritary
    package. RPM repository expects values in the range of 1 to 99 inclusive.
    A priority of 1 is the highest setting, and 99 is the lowest. If this field
    is not specified, the driver will setup the default priority is the lowest
    priority(0 for DEB and 99 for RPM)

Required fields are: name, uri, type.

As an example for RPM repositories, the input data format will have the
following yaml format:

.. code-block:: yaml

  repos:
    -   name: "centos"
        uri: "http://mirror.centos.org/centos/6/os/x86_64"
        type: "rpm"
        path: "/root/repo"
        priority: 1

    -   name: "centos-updates"
        uri: "http://mirror.centos.org/centos/6/updates/x86_64"
        type: "rpm"
        path: "/root/repo"
        priority: 99

And for DEB repositories:

.. code-block:: yaml

  repos:
    -   name: "ubuntu"
        uri: "http://localhost/ubuntu/updates"
        suite: "trusty"
        section: "main multiverse restricted universe"
        type: "deb"
        path: "/root/repo"
        priority: 1000

    -   name: "ubuntu-updates"
        uri: "http://localhost/ubuntu/updates"
        suite: "trusty-updates"
        section: "main multiverse restricted universe"
        type: "deb"
        path: "/root/repo"
        priority: 500

If the section filed is not specified, we have flat repository format [1]_ and
the input data for DEB repositories will be as follows:

.. code-block:: yaml

  repos:
    -   name: "ubuntu"
        uri: "http://localhost/ubuntu"
        type: "deb"
        suite: "/some/path"
        path: "/root/repo"

2. To use the following fields for the packages input data format:

  * name field - A single word identifying the package name

  * versions field - An optional parameter that specifies versions of the
    package. It is usually a sequence of integers separated by a dot. It can be
    prefixed with relational operator ('=', '>', '<', '>=', '<='). When
    specifying two or more versions in the package, it is necessary to use
    logic AND operator between versions. This means that the engine will select
    the package that satisfies all the specified versions.

For example:

.. code-block:: yaml

   packages:
    -   name: openssl
        versions:
        - ">= 1.0.1"
        - "< 1.0.2e-1ubuntu1"

3. Make repositories independent and use priority to figure out from where we
   need to download a package.


4. All given repositories are to be sorted. Sorting algorithm depends on a 
   repository driver and most likely they are sorted by their priorities. If a
   particular package is available in several repositories then it will be
   fetched from the repository that is earlier in this sorted list of repos.
