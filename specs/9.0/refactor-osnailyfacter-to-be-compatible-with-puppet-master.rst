Re-factor osnailyfacer Fuel Library Module to Be Compatible With Puppet Master
==============================================================================

https://blueprints.launchpad.net/fuel/+spec/fuel-refactor-osnailyfacter-for-puppet-master-compatibility

The Fuel Library module `deployment/puppet/osnailyfacter` is Fuel Library's
composition layer module.  In order to be able to use an LCM plugin to Fuel
& use a 3rd party service, such as Puppet Master, the modular manifests
contained in this module need to be consumable by a 3rd party service.

--------------------
Problem description
--------------------

The modular manifests contained inside of 'osnailyfacter/modular' were
designed for masterless Puppet apply tasks and were therefore placed inside
of 'osnailyfacter/modular' on purpose to keep them separate from any standard
classes located inside the 'manifests' directory, where Puppet looks for
classes. 

Under the Modular Fundamentals guidelines outlined by Puppetlabs, Puppet's
autoinclude looks in 'manifests' for Puppet manifests.  It does not know 
anything about any directory named 'modular'.  This means that the top-scope
modular manifests located inside of 'osnailyfacter/modular' are not
currently consumable by a plugin integration with Puppet Master.

----------------
Proposed changes
----------------

The contents of the modular manifests will be left alone but will be
re-organized into wrapper/profile classes under the 'osnailyfacter/manifests'
directory.

The configuration logic from the the manifests in 'osnailyfacter/modular' will
be moved into consumable profile classes by copying their contents to a file
of the same name, located in the 'osnailyfacter/manifests' directory.  We
will also wrap them in a class declaration, making them essentially profile
classes.  The manifest inside of 'osnailyfacter/modular/<manifest name>.pp
will be updated to simply include the new profile class.  For example:

  osnailyfacter/modular/ceph/ceph_pools.pp would have its contents copied to
  'osnailyfacter/manifests/ceph/ceph_pools.pp' and be wrapped inside of a
  class declaration for the class 'ceph::ceph_pools'.

  osnailyfacter/modular/ceph/ceph_pools.pp would contain just the following:

  'include ::osnailyfacter::ceph::ceph_pools'

  This would include the class and apply the same configuration logic that it
  did before, but by being wrapped inside of a consumable class inside the
  'osnailyfacter/manifests' directory, integration of a 3rd party plugin to
  consume the class is now possible.

The tasks.yaml file can still reference the same 'modular/<name>.pp' manifest.
By applying the include statement shown above, the manifest will still apply
the same configuration logic as it did before.  The location of the code has
just been reorganized into the 'manifests' directory.  No new feature is added
outside of making top-scope modular manifests consumable by 3rd party plugin
integrations.

Fuel Library
============

Each manifest contained inside of 'deployment/puppet/osnailyfacter/modular'
will have its contents copied into a corresponding file of the same name
in 'deployment/puppet/osnailyfacter/manifests' and will be wrapped inside of
a class declaration.  The manifest in the modular directory will have its
contents replaced with an include statement to include the new profile class.
For example:

  osnailyfacter/modular/ceph/ceph_pools.pp would contain:

  'include ::osnailyfacter::ceph::ceph_pools'

Nothing changes as far as what code is applied or in what order it is applied
via the standard granular deployment task doing a puppet apply on the manifest.

End user impact
---------------

This enables an end user to be able to enable LCM features via a Puppet Master
Fuel plugin.  Users can then have the ability to manage the day 2 operations
and configuration needs of their deployments.

No end user impact if not using a Puppet Master/LCM plugin as this enables
compatibility of the osnailyfacter composition layer for both master and
masterless puppet approaches.

Deployment impact

----------------
Developer impact
----------------

After this lands, developers would need to develop modular manifest code inside
of 'deployment/puppet/osnailyfacter/manifests' rather than under the current
directory 'deployment/puppet/osnailyfacter/modular'.

---------------------
Infrastructure impact
---------------------

None


--------------------
Documentation impact
--------------------

Documentation should be updated to reference putting modular manifest code in
the manifests directory rather than modular.

--------------
Implementation
--------------

The re-factoring work has already been done.  We should wait for a quiet period
after FF when this work can be rebased and landed.

Work Items
==========

* Identify changes dependent on https://review.openstack.org/#/c/281557/
  & https://blueprints.launchpad.net/fuel/+spec/fuel-remove-conflict-openstack

* After all FFE work concerning Fuel Library has been completed, merge 1 commit
  per directory in 'osnailyfacter/modular' that re-organizes the manifests in
  that directory to a directory of the same name in 'osnailyfacter/manifests',
  encompassing the entirety of modular manifests in 'osnailyfacter/modular' and
  all work that has been done up to that point.


Dependencies
============

Testing, QA
------------

Existing CI and BVT tests will catch regression as the same code will be
applied for each granular deployment task using a modular manifest.

Acceptance criteria
===================

* All top-scope modular manifests located inside of 'osnailyfacter/modular/'
  have had their contents copied under a wrapper class inside of the
  'osnailyfacter/manifests' directory.

* CI, BVT, & nightly swarm tests are all successful.

* Fuel deployment is successful while using the same granular deployment
  tasks as before the change.
