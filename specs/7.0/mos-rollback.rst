MOS Rollback
==========================================

https://blueprints.launchpad.net/fuel/+spec/mos-rollback

Snapshot based rollback implementation allows to checkout between versions using
checkpoint process and to recover node to the previous state using
provision and deploy stage.
Also this method includes database and virtual machine
images partition preservation.
(https://blueprints.launchpad.net/fuel/+spec/rollback-partition-preservation)

Problem description
===================

Currently fuel does not support any rollback solution.
Slave nodes can't be restored if error raised after patching


Proposed change
===============

Rollback feature includes multiple changes which should be implemented

* Making snapshot  repositories

* Partition Preservation (will be implemented separatelly) (https://blueprints.launchpad.net/fuel/+spec/rollback-partition-preservation)

* Node renaming (https://blueprints.launchpad.net/fuel/+spec/reset-count-from-one)

* MongoDB recovery in case of failure (assumed should be fixed in 7.0)

* Swift ring sync during redeploy (assumed should be fixed in 7.0)


  Rollback process

  1) All repos should be cloned on the to the customer side and managed by aptly or pacrat package tools
  2) The script checks repo updates and makes new checkpoint using package tool
     when update appears
  3) script should has posibility to simply checkout between snapshots
  4) The last step is the standart API calls - provision and deploy
     which should be applied to failed node using previous
     snapshot release
