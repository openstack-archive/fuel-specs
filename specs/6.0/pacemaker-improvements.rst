==========================================
Improve Corosync and Pacemaker management
==========================================

https://blueprints.launchpad.net/fuel/+spec/pacemaker-improvements [1]_

A next iteration of Corosync & Pacemaker improvements required by scaling
requirements, better Pacemaker management and new OS support.

Problem description
===================

The current Pacemaker implementation has some limitations:

* Doesn't allow to deploy a large amount of OpenStack Controllers

* Operations with CIB utilizes almost 100% of CPU on the Controller

* Corosync shutdown process takes a lot of time

* No support of new OSes as CentOS 7 or Ubuntu 14.04

* Current Fuel Architecture is limited to Corosync 1.x and Pacemaker 1.x

* Puppet service provider for pacemaker doesn't disable Upstart or SystemV
  services by default

* At current implementation ordering between resources is not specified

* Diff operations against Corosync CIB require to save data to file rather
  than keep all data in memory

* Debug process of OCF scripts is not unified requires a lot of actions from
  Cloud Operator

* No granular enough

* Openstack services are not managed by Pacemaker

* Compute nodes aren't in Pacemaker cluster, hence, are lacking a viable
  control plane for their's compute/nova services.

Proposed change
===============

* Support Fuel Controllers with Corosync 2.0 packages

* Get the puppet corosync module from puppetlabs and integrate it

* Rename OCF resources. Remove __old from resource names

* Refactor service provider and include disabling of the same services under
  systemd/upstart/system v

* Refactor provider and remove diff operation from files

* Add wrapper handler for OCF scripts or unify debug handling of OCF scripts

* Move pacemaker & corosync installation to own stage. Create own corosync.pp
  to make it more granular

Permissive change:

* Add all openstack services to pacemaker and make ordering

* Use monit as compute nodes' services additional control plane

Alternatives
------------

All changes are not critical and doesn't affect deployment or Cluster
Operation

Data model impact
-----------------

None

REST API impact
---------------

None

Upgrade impact
--------------

* Since Resources will be renamed Upgrade process should delete old resources
  on upgrade and delete new resource names on roll back.

* Corosync 2.x is NOT compatible with previous versions of Corosync (1.3/1.4).
  Please make sure to upgrade all nodes at once (full-downtime patching)

Security impact
---------------

None

Notifications impact
--------------------

None

Other end user impact
---------------------

None

Performance Impact
------------------

* Deployment process will be improved and will require less time as CIB
  operations will not require 100% CPU time

* Corosync 2.0 has a lot of improvements that allow to have up to 100
  Controllers. Corosync 1.0 scales up to 10-16 node

Other deployer impact
---------------------

None

Developer impact
----------------

* Enchanced pacemaker provider requires some refactoring of puppet manifests
  in Fuel Library manifests:

  - Upstream corosync manifests will replace our in-memory diff invention to
    standard approach: crm or pcs or cibadmin --patch '<xml patch>' directly.

  - Renaming vip primitives could require additional orchestration refactoring
    as well.

* New Pacemaker/monit control plane for Openstack services would require
  appropriate changes in manifests as well.

Work Items
----------

Mandatory items:

* Replace Corosync 1.0 with Corosync 2.0

* Synchronize corosync manifest with puppetlabs

* Refactor puppet service core provider. It should:

  - Disable systemd/upstart/system V when corosync system
    provider is enabled

* Redesing puppet manifests to start all OCF scripts via
  Wrapper

Permissive items:

* Add openstack services to Pacemaker

* Configure ordering between services in Pacemaker

* Configure monit for compute nodes' Openstack services

Dependencies
============

* Corosync 2.x packages

* Monit packages

Testing
=======

* Standard swarm testing are required.

* Manual HA testing is required.

* Rally testing is preffered but not mandatory.

* New control plane for Openstack services requires manual testing.

* New debug wrappers for OCF require manual testing.

Acceptance criteria
===================

* Openstack clouds deployed by Fuel are passing OSTF tests with
  Corosync 2.0 and new Pacemaker/monit control plane for services,
  if any.

* Debug wrappers for OCF do produce enough information but aren't too
  verbouse as well.

* VIP resources do not contain an _old postfix in their names.

* Upstart/system V control plane is disabled for services managed via
  Pacemaker OCF.

Documentation Impact
====================

* High Availability guide should be reviewed. For Ubuntu, crm tool stays 
  as is, but documentation should be as well enhanced with pcs
  equivivalents for Centos

* Upgrade/Patching impact should be described - corosync 2.0 upgrading
  assumes full downtime for cloud

* Changes to OCF debugging approach with bash wrappers should be described

* Renaming of VIP resources should be mentioned

* In case of Openstack services become managed by Pacemaker + monit, related
  changes for their new control plane should be described
