================================
Fuel with existed ldap
================================

https://blueprints.launchpad.net/fuel/+spec/fuel-with-existed-ldap


Problem description
===================

Currently the OpenStack environment deployed by Fuel only supports SQL for
the Keystone identity backend. In some cases we already have our own LDAP
(eg openLDAP, AD, etc.) authentication service and we prefer not to maintain
two authentication services in the our environment. Therefore, it would be
beneficial to support LDAP identity backend too. Given that the Keystone team
considers SQL as the preferred assignment backend, the idea of LDAP assignment
backend is against it and therefore we prefer using SQL as assignment backend
with no switch option.


Proposed change
===============

We could let Fuel to switch identity backend by adding setting options at
cluster wizard page as a trigger which allowing deployers to choose their own
identity backend with SQL, or pre-existing LDAP server which is read only.
Since Openstack documentation discourages using LDAP with other connection
mode beside read-only, I will keep it stick with read-only.
We also need an aditional setting block inside cluster setting tab for fill
up LDAP detail connection information include LDAP server administrator
information, identity domain scope, connection info, etc. Inside the
connection info, user can provide the user accounts from LDAP to Fuel after
they decided which account inside LDAP should be administrator to which
service in Openstack. An test connection button or link shloud be added
inside cluster setting tab too, to validate the settings.


Alternatives
------------

We can do nothing, but a deployer will not be able to use their pre-existed
LDAP as a identity backend for Openstack.


Data model impact
-----------------

We have to store following data in settings:

* The LDAP connection URL and login information.

* Customized LDAP configuration for user and group, include tree DNs, filter,
  object class, CRUD permissions.

* Each service correspond administrative account and its password in LDAP
  server. User account and password parameters should be provided from user
  to fuel, because we must also consider of LDAP's prospects. It's not health
  to force LDAP adding some extra account just for openstack can be fit in.
  Although the list can get quite long, we still can help user with some lazy
  options(user maybe can choose one account and apply to all others) if that
  is more preferred.


REST API impact
---------------

No REST API modifications needed.


Upgrade impact
--------------

I see no objections about upgrades. LDAP connection are based on LDAP
identity driver which is a part of official set of identity drivers. So any
upgrades should be done in a common way.


Security impact
---------------

LDAP traffic exchanged in clear-text could be bad for some customers. It
would be worth to add a section on LDAP over SSL.


Notifications impact
--------------------

Some modifications of the Cluster Creation Wizard needed. Add setting options
for switching identity backend purpose. Need an aditional setting block
inside cluster setting tab for fill up LDAP detail connection information
and a services administrator assigning forms for fill up administrator
assignment form LDAP account to Openstack environment.


Other end user impact
---------------------

Deployer will be able to switch to their own pre-existed LDAP with Cluster
Creation Wizard in Fuel deployment. As an operation requirement, if
pre-existed LDAP selected, Deployer must fill up more detail information in
cluster setting tab.


Performance Impact
------------------

None.


Other deployer impact
---------------------

None.


Developer impact
----------------

The Configuration pattern of Keystone with LDAP backend will be different
from original sql backend. We change identity backend and assign
administrator for each services and default project. This should be care
for while developing relatived patterns.
Developers would also be impacted by the code diverge between upstream
manifests for puppet openstack modules and the forked copies we maintain
in sync.

Work Items
----------

* Modify Cluster Creation Wizard page. Add switching identity backend option
  and test it.

* Modify Cluster setting tab. Add ldap connection information forms and test
  it.

* Modify Cluster setting tab. Add services administrator assigning forms and
  test it.

* Modify Keystone configuration pattern with LDAP backend information and
  test it.

* Modify all services configuration pattern with assigning administrator
  account from LDAP and test it.

* Change puppet manifests with user and group LDAP configuration in settings.
  Since LDAP is read only, puppet manifests should skip attempts creating
  default users or groups and using LDAP configuration as default setting.
  submitting all changes of required LDAP related bugs in corresponding
  upstream projects such as puppet-keystone, puppet-nova and so on.

* Update core puppet manifests from upstream projects.

* Create a pull request to Gerrit.

* Describe a test environment and additional System tests and discuss it in
  ML.

* Set up a test environment and provide System tests.

* Set up additional Jenkins jobs for System tests.


Dependencies
============

None


Testing
=======

* Additional functional tests for UI.

* Additional functional tests for puppet script.

* Additional System tests against a stand alone test environment(with ldap).

wrapped up as a separate Jenkins thread job.


Documentation Impact
====================

* The documentation should describe how to set up LDAP for a simple test
  environment.

* The documentation should warn about password expiration for service
  accounts(eg their passwords should nerver expire).

* The documentation should warn user to make sure LDAP/AD read connection
  available from openstack keystone service and no futher authorize granted.
