===================================
Neutron ML2 plugin support for Fuel
===================================


https://blueprints.launchpad.net/fuel/+spec/ml2-neutron

Fuel needs to support this:

* Much of the newer functionality in plugins is only supported when using the
  ML2 plugin.
* Using the ML2 Plugin format forces more common configuration allowing for
  plugins to more easily be interchanged.
* Many of the vendor or NFV plugs only work inside ML2 plugin format.
* ML2 format allows for multiple concurrent plugins.


Problem description
===================

Monolithic Neutron plugins are deprecated in Ice-house and will be removed in
Juno. Fuel needs to be able to support this as it is the assumed entry point
for all 3rd party modules.


Proposed change
===============

Some simple changes to the data structure sent by nailgun should allow for us
to take advantage of the upstream puppet-neutron
https://github.com/stackforge/puppet-neutron module. Some work will need to
be taken in order to add back in our HA support into the module, however upon
review this action may also help to simplify the neutron module and increase
its effectiveness.

Puppet modules

Items to discuss:

* sanitize_network_config: should be removed, we should be doing all of this
  in NeutronNetworkDeploymentSerializer or rely on the defaults in the puppet
  manifests and neutron.
* waistline: appears to be un-necessary and should be removed.
* create_predefined_networks_and_routers: This will need to be abstracted into
  a method that can be consumed by the manifests or carried forward in the
  interim.

HA issues:

the neutron services are hard-coded into pacemaker in their respective
classes. These will need to be abstracted into a composition layer that can
then hook back into the upstream module without mangling with upstream module
code.

See https://github.com/xarses/fuel-library/commit/8278087d97e4e6c0c5793ff0f20801f9c5447b7c#diff-6

the services with pacemaker/corosync are:

* neutron-l3-agent
* neutron-dhcp-agent
* neutron-openvswitch-agent
* neutron-metadata-agent


Alternatives
------------

We can back port relevant portions of the ml2 plugin code from upstream,
however this will further separate us from upstream which we want to work on
regardless.

Data model impact
-----------------

Some changes to the astute.yaml:

* rename quantum_settings to neutron_settings
* add setting to track mechanisms
* add setting to track type_drivers
* add setting to track if using l2_population
* add setting to track if using arp_responder


REST API impact
---------------

None

Upgrade impact
--------------

None

Security impact
---------------

None

Notifications impact
--------------------

None

Other end user impact
---------------------

Changes in layout of astute.yaml

Performance Impact
------------------

New code should reduce dependency complexity and hopefully improve deployment
performance.

Other deployer impact
---------------------

quantum_settings should be further re-factored to more closely resemble the
 data structure consumed by the neutron model, however its not a priority at
 this time.

Developer impact
----------------

this will change the astute.yaml layout which would case it to become
incompatible with older versions.

Beyond this implementation
--------------------------

(Things out of scope for this blueprint but should be kept in mind)

Follow-up actions:

* possibly clean up q-agent-cleanup.py, there is open bug about time it
  takes to run
* Its not necessary to run DHCP agent in HA, we can run more than one per
  network as HA solution.
* need to support linuxbridge, this should be simply allowing network_scheme
  in astute.yaml to have less data, and passing slightly different data to
  quantum_settings.
* ml2-plugin supports multiple type_drivers at a time, nailgun and UI should
  be updated to allow for this as well.



Implementation
==============

Assignee(s)
-----------

Primary assignee:
  xarses (Andrew Woodward)

Other contributors:
  xenolog (Sergey Vasilenko)

Work Items
----------

:

* Research ml2-plugin usage and config 1d
* Compare current neutron plugin with upstream 1d
* Model changes to pull down upstream 2d
* Produce working prototype 2d
* Submit for review and testing 2d


Dependencies
============

* This work is inclusive of pulling upstream puppet modules


Children of this are:

* https://blueprints.launchpad.net/fuel/+spec/mellanox-features-support
* https://blueprints.launchpad.net/fuel/+spec/neutron-nsx-plugin-integration
* https://blueprints.launchpad.net/fuel/+spec/neutron-vxlan-support

Testing
=======

Current CI should provide sufficient coverage as we are not adding new
 features at this time

Upstream module contains significantly more rspec testing than current module.


Documentation Impact
====================

Docs can be updated to reflect that ml2 plugin is used, and that other options
 might be supplied.
