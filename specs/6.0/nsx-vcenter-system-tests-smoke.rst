Integration of automated system tests for NSX and vCenter features
==================================================================

Related to blueprint:
https://blueprints.launchpad.net/fuel/+spec/nsx-vcenter-system-tests-smoke

Problem description
===================

We have a lot of acceptance and smoke test cases for NSX and vCenter features,
but we haven't got enough time to perform it manually during feature freeze
milestone.

Proposed change
===============

Enable support of automated system tests which are based on manual
acceptance test cases of vCenter and NSX features.
It will allow us to reduce the time to perform a comprehensive acceptance
testing, according to manual test cases that we've already created
considering different parameters and modes.

Alternatives
------------

If it is not implemented in time, we will perform only manual tests with
'High' priority.

* Create automated system tests according to manual acceptance test
  cases with different configuration and parameters for nsx and
  vcenter features, to check that nsx and vcenter features are successfully
  integrated with each other;
* Verify that according to blueprints of this release our features with
  additional settings that are in scope of release work fine;
* Set up a test environment and debug tests on host, that is allocated for it;
* Add these tests in already existing Jenkins jobs.

Dependencies

Testing
=======

Check that all tests are implemented according to the required workflow
and they run stably in Jenkins jobs.
