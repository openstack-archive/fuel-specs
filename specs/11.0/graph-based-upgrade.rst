==========================================
Graph Based Upgrades
==========================================

https://blueprints.launchpad.net/fuel/+spec/graph-based-upgrade

This spec aims to improve Octane by making use of Fuel's graph execution engine
to run upgrade-related commands and procedures.

--------------------
Problem description
--------------------

Currently, Octane executes upgrade-related commands on cluster nodes
via SSH. This is not the best way to handle upgrades, given the
capability to execute custom graphs on both new and old environments.
This will allow to enhance upgrade experience in following ways:
- More consistent with Fuel way of logging of upgrade commands
- Utilization of existing graph execution framework for upgrades
- Puppet usage for upgrade tasks (where it is possible to do so)

----------------
Proposed changes
----------------

For each upgrade action, there will be one optional CLI argument:
--with-graph, which will enforce graph-based approach to said
operation.

Graphs and puppet manifests will be stored in the same repository,
in "deployment/" directory (similar to fuel-library).

There will be two types of graphs: "seed" and "orig" for new and old
environments respectively.

Graphs will be uploaded during upgrade action execution.

Graphs will be uploaded to concrete environments (similar to
fuel2 graph upload --env <id> execution)

Alternatives

Stick with current Octane implementation based on existing Python code.

--------------
Upgrade impact
--------------

All the changes will be introduced into fuel-octane repo.
To make use of this feature, the user will have to
run all upgrade actions with "--with-graph" flag.


---------------
Security impact
---------------

Graph-based upgrades require that master node has additional directories
configured for rsync remote access:

- (Read only) /var/www/nailgun/octane_code (contains Puppet-related Octane
  files)
- (Read/write) /var/www/nailgun/octane_data (will hold temporary/backup data
  from other nodes)

Note: due to the nature of upgrade process, the second directory may contain
sensitive data. Contents of this directory are not to be cleaned automatically.
It will be operator's responsibility to remove files with sensitive information
from this directory.

E.g. during upgrade-db step, OpenStack database's contents will be dumped to a
file on the original environment's node, synced to /var/www/nailgun/octane_data
on the master node and then synced to the seed environment's node.
